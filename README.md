i want to create a game where i will rescue a hostage. the hostage and my movement will remain same. there will be enemies and obstacles. different obstacles will be in different shape and will decrease life in different values. Enemies will be coming towards me and the hostage. Obstacle will remain in the same position. if a certain amount of life is gone the game will be over. i will have a gun on my hand and can kill enemies with that gun by firing. there will be a limitation of miss fire and the game will be over if we cross that line. if we collude with the enemy our life will be decreased. we will also able to collect gems to increase score. after reaching a certain score where new environment will be created and the difficulties will rise . we can use emergency shield 1 or 2 times. we can pick up ammos from the ground# cse423project
